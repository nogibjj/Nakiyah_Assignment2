# Nakiyah Dhariwala - Assignment 2
# Week 2

[![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/Nakiyah_Assignment2/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/Nakiyah_Assignment2/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

In the first assignment, we developed a Python template incorporating best practices for organizing a Python project. For this second assignment, we will build on that template to write a Python script that reads a CSV file, utilizes Pandas to generate descriptive statistics, and produces both statistical outputs and visualizations.
### Run the main.py file to generate the pdf report and visualizations


## Repository contents:
1. .devcontainer directory (a) devcontainer.json (b) Dockerfile
2. .github/worflows/cicd.yml --> this is configuration file that defines the steps necessary to build, test, and deploy an application.
3. .gitignore --> to ensure some cache files like "pychache" do not get pushed to the github repo.
4. Makefile --> which sets rules to manage the dependencies of the source files of the programs during the compilation and linking (build) phase.
5. Requirements.txt --> contains a list of packages/libraries needed to work on this project that can all be installed with the file.
6. main.py --> Reads a CSV file, generates descriptive summary statistics, and produces data visualizations.
7. test_main.py --> Tests the functionality of main.py by verifying the accuracy of the descriptive summary statistics and the correctness of the generated visualizations

## Functions inside the main.py
- readData(): Reads the input CSV file and loads the data into a pandas DataFrame.
- cleanData(): Cleans the dataset by removing duplicates and selecting relevant columns.
- summaryStatistics(): Generates summary statistics, including the median, for the selected data.
- stackPlot(): Creates a stacked bar plot based on the provided x and stack values.
- barPlot(): Generates a horizontal bar plot, displaying the average of a variable segregated by another variable.
- writeToPDF(): Combines the summary statistics and generated plots into a PDF report.
