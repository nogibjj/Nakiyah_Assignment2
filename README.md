# Nakiyah Dhariwala - Assignment 2
# Week 2

In the first assignment, we developed a Python template incorporating best practices for organizing a Python project. For this second assignment, we will build on that template to write a Python script that reads a CSV file, utilizes Pandas to generate descriptive statistics, and produces both statistical outputs and visualizations.

This repository contains:

1. devcontainer directory (a) devcontainer.json (b) Dockerfile
2. github directory worflows directory cicd.yml --> this is configuration file that defines the steps necessary to build, test, and deploy an application.
3. .gitignore --> to ensure some cache files like "pychache" do not get pushed to the github repo.
4. Makefile --> which sets rules to manage the dependencies of the source files of the programs during the compilation and linking (build) phase.
5. Requirements --> contains a list of packages/libraries needed to work on this project that can all be installed with the file.
